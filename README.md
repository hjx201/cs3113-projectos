# cs3113-projectos

My projects that I did for CS 3113 Intro to Game Programming. (please ignore the very random commit messages, this was a personal repo and I am capable of writing signed and proper commit messages)

Source code for most projects can be found in main.cpp.

All projects were made using OpenGL and SDL libraries in C++.

P1: making objects move \n
P2: Pong \n
P3: Lunar Lander \n 
P4: Rise of the AI \n
P5: Platformer \n
P6: Free project (created a clone of the game Asteroids) \n
